Final Group Project of R for Analytics.
Used R to analyze NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort) data set.

Fo this project, we examined what factors could influence the income, specifically, we examined how gender would make a difference among these variables and income. The variables we checked are: income, sex, weed.use.97(EVER USE MARIJUANA?), hard.drug.use.98(EVER USE COCAINE/HARD DRUGS?), weed.use.00, weed.use.05, weed.use.11, hard.drug.use.11, industry, sat.math(SAT Math Score), education(Highest Degree), kid18(NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS UNDER AGE 18), kid6(NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS UNDER AGE 6).
